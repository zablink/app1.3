Zablink is a local business directory platform connecting shops and consumers in Thailand. We use TikTok Login for user authentication.

**Scope `user.info.basic` usage:**
- Open ID: Unique identifier linking TikTok account to Zablink account
- Display Name: Pre-fills profile name and displays in reviews/interactions
- Avatar URL: Sets user profile picture

**Product integration:**
1. Authentication: Users sign in/register with TikTok. Basic info creates/updates Zablink profiles.
2. User Profiles: TikTok name and avatar appear in profiles, reviews, bookmarks.
3. Reviews: Users create business reviews; TikTok identity adds credibility.
4. Shop Management: Business owners use TikTok login to manage shop accounts.

**Data handling:** We only collect the three basic fields. Data is stored securely and used exclusively within Zablink for identification and profile display. We do not share TikTok data with third parties. Users can disconnect anytime.
